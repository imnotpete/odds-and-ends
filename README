This is just a collection of scripts and snippits I've accumulated and would rather not lose.

Catalog:

python/servethis: a simple httpserver that can be run on-demand from any arbitrary directory

bash/bloopbackup: a script to backup diaries from bloopdiary.com
bash/yahoochecker: a script to watch and see when a specific Yahoo! IM user comes online
