This is just a collection of scripts and snippits I've accumulated and would rather not lose.

## Catalog:

### arduino
**2key:** firmware for a 2key macropad keyboard that prints binary (1 or 0 on tapping, space or backspace on hold); cribbed from [this six key sketch](https://github.com/theimmc/six-key-pad)

### bash
**backupCharacters:** a script to backup character sheets from my [D&D character builder](https://github.com/imnotpete/characterbuilder)

**bloopbackup:** a script to backup diaries from bloopdiary.com

**yahoochecker:** a script to watch and see when a specific Yahoo! IM user comes online

### dotfiles
**bashrc:** custom bashrc configuration I want to share between machines (mostly my preferred aliases). Imported with "source ~/git/odds-and-ends/dotfiles/bashrc" in my local .bashrc file

**vimrc:** custom Vim configuration. Symlinked to ~/.vimrc

### python
**servethis:** a simple httpserver that can be run on-demand from any arbitrary directory
